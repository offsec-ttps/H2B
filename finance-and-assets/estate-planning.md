Include the following Estate Planning subcategories with the ability to **upload, store, manage, and track legal documents, contact information, and designations**:

1. **Wills and Trusts** – Upload and manage digital copies of wills, living trusts, and related documents; store executor and attorney contact information; visualize estate value over time.
2. **Beneficiary Designations** – Track and connect financial accounts (bank, retirement, insurance, etc.) to nominated beneficiaries; alert users of missing or outdated assignments.
3. **Power of Attorney** – Manage durable and medical POA documents; assign trusted contacts and notify stakeholders when changes occur; allow status tracking and renewal alerts.

Follow the 20-point framework to ensure:

* Human-centered UX/UI for all life stages and backgrounds.
* Real-time syncing with cloud databases for security and performance.
* Custom user journeys (e.g., first-time estate planners, aging adults, families).
* Ethical AI and privacy-first architecture.
* API-ready structure for third-party legal services, insurance, and document verification providers.
* Multilingual support and accessibility features.
* In-app education on estate planning laws, use cases, and best practices globally.
* Smart alerts/reminders for will reviews, legal changes, or beneficiary updates.
* Responsive layouts with light/dark mode and adaptive components.

The platform should allow:

* Drag-and-drop document uploads.
* Interactive data visualization for total asset coverage, gaps, risk exposure.
* PDF export and sharing features.
* Estate progress score and guided checklist.
* Role-based access control (e.g., view-only for family, edit for attorney).

The platform must use a cloud-native architecture (Kubernetes, serverless functions) with RESTful API-first development. Ensure real-time responsiveness, scalable microservices, and offline capabilities. Integrate advanced cybersecurity protocols (Zero Trust, encryption, OAuth) and adhere to global compliance standards including GDPR, CCPA, ISO 9001, SOC 2, and estate-specific laws like the Uniform Probate Code.

Design methodology should follow Agile, Lean, and Design Thinking principles, integrating insights from legal professionals, UX designers, AI engineers, and financial experts. Build co-creation workflows with user feedback mechanisms (NPS, surveys, analytics), transparent changelogs, and open beta programs.

Incorporate adaptive machine learning to tailor estate plans to demographic-specific goals, such as simple wills for students, advanced trusts for entrepreneurs, and digital legacy planners for tech-savvy users. Implement visual guides, onboarding wizards, and guest mode access to reduce barriers.

Ensure ethical AI by making systems transparent, explainable, and non-biased. Provide full data ownership, privacy controls, and the right to be forgotten. Integrate real-time syncing with banks, insurance platforms, and document management providers using secure OAuth-based APIs.

Include impact reporting, sustainability metrics (e.g., CO2 saved via paperless workflows), and educational dashboards for financial and legal empowerment.

The final product must deliver intuitive estate planning, compliance, customization, mental wellness, and financial literacy in a single secure platform that works across devices and is usable by people of all ages, cultures, and ability levels worldwide.
