You are a full-stack AI developer. Build a modern, responsive React web application named "Friendship & Social Bonds" as part of a "Relationships & Social Life" module. The app should help users strengthen and sustain friendships through multiple interactive features and offer an AI chat assistant to improve relationships.

Features to implement:

1. Friendship Goals

* Editable goal cards like "Reconnect with college friend," "Plan weekend trip."
* Add deadlines, categories (e.g., reconnect, celebrate, support).

2. Friendship Tracker

* Enable logging of friend interactions: calls, chats, and closeness rating.
* Table or calendar view to log frequency and type of contact (call, text, video).
* Friend-wise closeness score based on frequency and recency.
* Sortable by last interaction, closeness level, or priority.
* Visualize frequency and depth of interactions with charts.

3. Trust Score & Interaction Logs

* Smart trust index per friend (scale from 0–100) calculated using sentiment, consistency, and conflict data.
* Store detailed interaction logs with timestamps and notes.
* Timeline of key past exchanges with emotional tags like “Strengthened”, “Drifting”, “Needs Attention”.

4. Shared Memories & Milestones

* Users can add and browse shared memories with friends.
