Here is the **final compiled Replit AI prompt** for the **"Personality & Social Wellness"** module, combining all three sources into a single world-class specification. It is formatted for use directly in Replit AI or any advanced coding assistant, **without markdown**:

You are a senior full-stack AI developer. Build a modern, responsive React web application named "Personality & Social Wellness" as part of a holistic Relationships project in the Human 2nd Brain platform. This module promotes self-awareness, emotional balance, and sustainable social engagement through interactive tools, intelligent tracking, journaling, visual dashboards, and an AI assistant for personalized guidance. Before building, analyze which features already exist and only add missing ones. Avoid duplication.

Main Objective:\
Empower users to understand their personality type (e.g., introvert/extrovert), manage their social energy, balance personal and social life, resolve conflicts peacefully, and access mental health support. It should help users cultivate emotional wellness, confidence, gratitude, and resilience.

Core Features to Build or Verify:

1. Introvert/Extrovert Insights:\
   Provide quizzes and personality profiling tools with dynamic visual feedback. Help users understand their social tendencies and offer behavior-aligned suggestions. Include MBTI-style assessments or integrate with APIs like Truity. Visualize insights using engaging radar or bar charts.
2. Social Energy Battery & Burnout Alerts:\
   Create a visual energy battery meter that fills or drains based on logged social activity. Track energy capacity over time. Send burnout alerts when overextended. Sync with devices like Fitbit to enhance stress prediction.
3. Life Balance Tracker (Social vs Personal):\
   Allow users to log time and activities split between social, personal, and work life. Show real-time and historical visualizations using pie charts, stacked bar charts, and donut graphs. Integrate with Google Calendar for time analysis.
4. Personalized Tips for Recharge:\
   Use AI to analyze patterns and recommend specific actions such as solo walks, guided meditations, or quiet time based on user type and history. Display suggestions on a dashboard or push as motivational pop-ups. Include actionable, empathetic content inspired by Calm or Headspace.
5. Happiness & Social Well-being Index:\
   Create a composite score using factors like mood, energy, journaling, and activity levels. Display happiness and well-being trends via line charts, gauges, and emotional heatmaps. Update weekly or monthly.
6. Conflict Resolution Journal:\
   Build a secure, private journaling interface with guided prompts to help users reflect on interpersonal conflict. Encourage personal growth through suggested strategies. Lock entries with encryption or passcodes for privacy. Allow export to Notion or private storage.
7. Gratitude & Reflection Journaling:\
   Offer daily prompts for gratitude and emotional reflection. Allow rich text, emoji tagging, audio entries, or photo notes. Use streak calendars to show consistency. Allow users to filter by emotion or theme.
8. Mental Health Resources:\
   Curate access to trusted tools, links, and articles related to social fatigue, anxiety, and emotional balance. Include emergency contacts, first-aid chatbot guidance, or referral to apps like BetterHelp and Calm.
9. AI Social Wellness Coach Chat:\
   Integrate a conversational AI assistant powered by OpenAI or Ollama. The assistant should understand mood entries, journaling content, and user behavior to give empathetic advice and actionable wellness tips. It must support streaming responses, maintain emotional context, and optionally offer mindfulness challenges.
