Replit AI, help me design the frontend of a world-class "Relationships & Social Life" module for my Human 2nd Brain project mentioned below in 3 steps - follow the instruction\
Step -1\
Create a responsive React project (with Tailwind CSS) for a “Human 2nd Brain – Relationships & Social Life” module.\
Set up a clean layout structure with a global sidebar and top navigation bar. Include routing using React Router for the following major sections:

* Romantic Relationships
* Friendships & Social Bonds
* Family & Home Life
* Social Life & Events
* Personality & Social Wellness

Each route should display a placeholder component with the section name and include sample sub-navigation tabs or breadcrumbs within the page layout. Keep the UI minimalist, responsive, and accessible.

Step -2\
Build the main "Relationships" dashboard page for the module with the following components:

* Relationship Pulse (with Love Index and Family Bond Index as visual scores)

* Upcoming Milestones (list of upcoming birthdays, anniversaries, events)
* Pending Actions or Relationship Goals
* Prominent “Quick Add” buttons: Add Interaction, Add Contact, Log Journal, Plan Event
* Sidebar with links to all main sections and submodules

Use Tailwind and chart libraries (like Recharts or Chart.js) for visual elements. Ensure hover tooltips and mobile responsiveness.

* Partner Profile (photo, name, key dates)
